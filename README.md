# Base-Classes-and-Queues-Lesson-Plan
Teaching Base classes and queues to high school students. 

## Reflection
This feels like how I would ideally teach an algorithsms and data structures class. I think Data Structures and Algorithsma was one of the most challenging classes for us to learn. If I were to take this class again, I would want it to be layed out the way I've demonstrated here where it has clear goals that can be directly posted and outlined in different agile goals. I think the importance of stand=ups and sprints cannot be understated enough.
One of the challenges for me was learnign how to code with a partner. I really struggled with understanding what it was like to balence out the workload and communicating needs. I think it would be more helpful having a 3rd team member who could deligate the work and organize us better. 
This class ideally would have included more coding and scaffolding for the students espeically because it was last minute made into an asyncryous course.
